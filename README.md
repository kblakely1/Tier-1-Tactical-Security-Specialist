# Tier-1-Tactical-Security-Specialist
This is my Code Louisville Project Repository
My project is a security website that offers personal security to different venues.
We can provide security for birthday parties car dealerships and stores.
My three features for my project are a menu button that only appears in moblie view using a javascript function. My two CSS features include using flex-box with my images and the creation of a navingation menu that changes betwween vertical and horizontal.
